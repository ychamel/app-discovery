# CONTROL.md — Project Control Board

**This is the durable channel between the user and the agent.** It replaces chat
memory. The agent reads it first every session and updates it last. The user checks
this one file to know *where we are* and *what is waiting on a decision*.

Rules:
- The agent **must not** act on a question listed under *Decisions Needed From You*
  until the user answers it here.
- Every work session ends by updating *Current State* and the *Activity Log*.
- Keep it short and current. Detail lives in the feature artifacts, not here.

## Current State

| Field            | Value                                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active feature** | `identity-accounts`                                            |
| **Stage**          | `1-define`                                                     |
| **Persona**        | Product Analyst (see [phase-1-product-analyst.md](process/personas/phase-1-product-analyst.md)) |
| **Folder**         | [features/identity-accounts/](features/identity-accounts/)     |
| **Last updated**   | 2026-06-14                                                     |

### Latest session status (CLAUDE.md §6.7 — overwritten each session)

```
Stage: 1-define | Feature: identity-accounts | Persona: Coordinator → Product Analyst (handoff)
Done: Resolved D1–D3; logged D-1 (niche) and D-2 (no-constraints) in global DECISIONS.md;
      un-gated identity-accounts privacy open question; activated identity-accounts into 1-define.
Verified by: n/a (coordination/bookkeeping only — no code, no tests this session)
Blocked/Deferred: signal-capture postponed (deeper design choices). Behavioral-data privacy
      posture un-gated but still undecided — owned by signal-capture, flagged for identity-accounts.
Decisions needed: none open
Next: Adopt the Product Analyst and write features/identity-accounts/FEATURE_BRIEF.md (Stage 1).
```

## Decisions Needed From You

The agent is blocked on these. Answer inline (edit the **Answer** cell), then the agent
proceeds.

_None open. D1–D3 were answered and have been moved to their durable homes (see
**Decisions Made** below)._

---

## Decisions Made (recently)

A short, human-readable digest. Full rationale lives in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
(global) or `features/<slug>/DECISIONS.md` (local).

- **D1 → beachhead niche = "vibecoded webapps"** (small web apps from solo/tiny-team devs, often AI-assisted). Repo-wide; logged as [D-1](DECISIONS.md). Scopes taxonomy, submission, founding catalog.
- **D2 → first feature = `identity-accounts`.** Chosen by dependency order ("go by dependencies"); it is the deepest Phase-0 root (signal-capture, submission-intake, interest-profile all depend on it). `signal-capture` deliberately **postponed** despite the breakdown's recommendation — it needs deeper design choices (cross-platform attribution + privacy fork).
- **D3 → no hard constraints up front; start small, scale as we go.** Repo-wide; logged as [D-2](DECISIONS.md). Non-functional targets deferred per-feature; CLAUDE.md §5.2 still binds.

## Activity Log

Newest first. One line per session. **Keep the most recent ~20 rows here**; when it
grows past that, move older rows to `process/activity-archive.md` so this dashboard
stays quick to scan. The per-feature folders remain the full record either way.

| Date       | Stage           | Summary                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2026-06-14 | `0-coordinator` | Resolved D1–D3. Logged niche (D-1) + no-constraints posture (D-2) in global [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); un-gated the identity-accounts privacy open question. **Activated `identity-accounts` into `1-define`** (by dependency order; signal-capture postponed). Handed off to Product Analyst — did not run Stage 1 (one persona per session). |
| 2026-06-13 | `0-coordinator` | Transformed [docs/mvp-component-breakdown.md](docs/mvp-component-breakdown.md) §4 into 11 scaffolded feature folders (7 artifacts each, briefs/open-questions seeded with breakdown facts + §7 questions); registered all in [features/INDEX.md](features/INDEX.md) as `backlog` in dependency-build order. No feature activated — that is D2 (user's call). |
| 2026-06-13 | `0-coordinator` | Decomposed the vision doc into separately-designable MVP components → [docs/mvp-component-breakdown.md](docs/mvp-component-breakdown.md). Recommends `signal-capture` as the first feature (informs D2); no decision taken. |
| 2026-06-13 | `0-coordinator` | Migrated `chain-of-thought.md` (14-step protocol → Architect persona) and `Design-strategy.md` (determinism rule + release-level DoD → CLAUDE.md §2/§6) into the personas/manual, then deleted both source files; personas are now self-contained specs. |
| 2026-06-13 | `0-coordinator` | Added `CODEMAP.md`, global `DECISIONS.md`, `features/INDEX.md`; wired code-reuse + global-decision tracking into the personas and CLAUDE.md. |
| 2026-06-13 | `0-coordinator` | Set up persona pipeline (CLAUDE.md, personas, folders). Awaiting D1–D3. |
